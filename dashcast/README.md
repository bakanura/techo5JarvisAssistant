# dashcast

Shows Home Assistant dashboards on TECHO5 screens, exactly as Home Assistant draws them, custom cards
and themes included.

An Echo Show is too small to run Home Assistant's frontend itself. dashcast runs a headless Chrome
on a machine that can, opens the dashboard at the screen's size, and sends the screen only the parts
that change, as pictures, over a connection encrypted with a key you choose. Where the screen is touched goes back and is replayed on the page. While
a page scrolls, the pictures go at half size, and the full-size ones follow once it stops.

TECHO5 can also draw a dashboard itself, with no server at all. That is quicker to the touch but
knows only the common cards. dashcast is for a dashboard that looks the way you made it.

## Running it

It needs:

- a long-lived access token from a **Home Assistant user made for this, who is not an
  administrator** (see [Security](#security)). Make the user in **Settings → People → Users → Add
  user**, with **Administrator** off. Sign in as it once, then make the token in its profile,
  **Security**, **Long-lived access tokens**. The dashboards are shown as that user sees them.
- a key of your own choosing, which each device has to present. Any long random string will do.

```sh
cat > .env <<'END'
HA_TOKEN=your-long-lived-token
DASHCAST_KEY=a-long-random-string
END
docker compose up -d
```

Set `HA_URL` in `docker-compose.yml` to Home Assistant's address as seen from this machine.

About 150 to 250 MB of memory per screen showing a dashboard, and very little CPU once a page has
loaded: nothing is sent while nothing changes.

### Updating a container you started by hand

If dashcast runs as a plain `docker run` container rather than from the compose file,
`update.sh` builds a given commit of this repository and swaps it in, with the running container's
address and port, shared memory, restart policy and settings:

```sh
sh update.sh <commit>
```

The container it replaces is stopped and kept as `dashcast-previous`, and the script ends with the
two commands that bring it back. With compose, `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d` does
the same.

## Pointing a device at it

Tell the device where the server is and what its key is, either on the device's **setup page**
(**Connections** tab, **Dashboard server**), or with the action **ESPHome: `<device>`_dashboard_server**.

Then, on the device's page in Home Assistant (**Settings → Devices & services → Devices →** the
device, **Configuration** card):

1. Set **Dashboard** to **Streamed**.
2. Pick the dashboard in **Dashboard to show**. Home Assistant's built-in pages (Energy, History,
   Logbook…) are at the end of the list.
3. Turn on **Dashboard when idle** to show it in place of the clock.

On an Echo Show, swipe in from the left edge of the clock to open it; on the Spot, pick Dashboard
in the ring menu. More in [docs/dashboards.md](../docs/dashboards.md).

## Security

The browser dashcast runs is signed in to Home Assistant with the token, and a device drives it by
touch. So treat the token and the key with care:

- **Use a user that is not an administrator.** dashcast only shows dashboards: it refuses any other
  page a device asks for (Settings, Developer Tools, add-ons, the profile), and brings the page back
  to its dashboard if it gets anywhere else. A user without administrator rights is the second wall
  behind that: Home Assistant itself will not show that user those pages, whatever happens.
- **Keep the port on your own network.** Anyone who can reach it and knows the key can see the
  dashboards and use them. The compose file can bind it to this machine's own LAN address only (for
  example `"192.168.1.20:9555:9555"`). **Never forward the port from your router.**
- **The connection is encrypted, with the key.** A device and dashcast prove to each other that
  they have the same key without sending it (a Noise handshake, as the device's own link to Home
  Assistant uses), and everything after that, pictures and touches, is encrypted. A device with the
  wrong key simply cannot connect.
- **Custom cards run with the token.** A custom card's code runs in dashcast's browser, as that
  user, exactly as it would in yours. Install custom cards you trust, as you would anyway.
- **The key.** At least 16 characters, and random: `openssl rand -base64 24` is one way. dashcast
  will not start with a shorter one.
- **Dashboards only.** Webpage dashboards are not shown, because they are often a tool (a code
  editor, the ESPHome dashboard) that anyone with the key could then use. Neither are Settings, the
  add-ons or Developer Tools.
- **A Show can be its own user.** A Show set to use its own Home Assistant user sends that user's
  token inside the encrypted connection, and its page is then signed in as that user, in a browser
  profile of its own, rather than as dashcast's. dashcast asks Home Assistant whose the token is
  each time the Show connects. An administrator's token, or one Home Assistant refuses, is not used:
  the Show gets dashcast's own user and the log says why. The token is never written to the log.
- **Up to 8 screens at once.** Each is a browser tab of a couple of hundred megabytes; a ninth is
  told the server is full.
