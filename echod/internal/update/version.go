// Ranking two versions the way Home Assistant does, so the device can act on the same answer the card
// shows. AwesomeVersion, which is what Home Assistant ranks with, compares the dotted numerals as
// numbers, throws away anything after the underscore, and sorts a prerelease below the release of the
// same numbers: v0.7.13 beats v0.7.9, and v0.8.0-beta.4 loses to v0.8.0.
//
// Only versions matching versionPattern get here — ValidVersion refuses the rest before a manifest is
// believed — so this does not have to rank names, dates or tags. Anything it cannot read says so with
// its second result instead of guessing an order; OTA callers fail closed when ordering is unknown.

// Newer reports whether offered is strictly newer than running. If either side cannot be ranked, the
// safe answer is false: a root updater must not guess ordering for an ad-hoc build and accidentally
// walk it backwards. Release/CI builds are required to stamp a ValidVersion.
