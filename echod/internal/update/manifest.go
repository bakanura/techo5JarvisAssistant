//
// The device does not compare versions: Home Assistant does that, with a parser that forces the update
// card permanently on for anything it cannot rank. So Version has to stay something AwesomeVersion can
// read — dotted numerals, optionally a prerelease, and any build detail after an underscore, which is
// where Home Assistant truncates before comparing.
