// Brain is where a turn's speech and answer come from when they do not come from Home Assistant: the
// direct pipeline (feature/voice/direct.go). Speech to text and text to speech are Wyoming servers
// (faster-whisper and Piper, as Home Assistant itself uses), and the answer is a chat model behind an
// OpenAI-style endpoint (llama.cpp's server, Ollama, and so on), which acts through the device's own
// abilities as tools. Empty Mode is Home Assistant's Assist pipeline, as always.
