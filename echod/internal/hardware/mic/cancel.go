// cancelTaps is how far the filter reaches, in samples, so 64 ms of tail. Not a setting: measured on

// 1024, 27.2 at 2048 — so there is no room-dependent best value to look for, only what the device can
// afford. This costs 6.4% of a core, and only while something is playing.

// About -76 dBFS. Below it there is no echo to remove, so the filter is skipped entirely and the frame
// costs nothing — which is what keeps this free on an idle device. It has to sit well under a
// radio at a quiet volume: measured at -50 dBFS on the loopback, which a -60 dBFS gate flapped on
// every second, resetting the canceller each time.

// refLoud is the same measure, about -54 dBFS, above which the loopback is loud enough to bury a word
// said over it. Only then does the detector get its slack (Masking). The canceller starts far below
// this, on a reference too faint to hide anything, and a TV in the room woke the device twice that way:
// the run was started by a loopback at -64 and -60 dBFS, the slack dropped the cutoff by a tenth, and
// the TV's speech crossed it.

// past 100 ms, so disengaging on the gap stops canceling exactly as that tail arrives. A second
// covers it with room to spare, and rides across the pauses in a radio talk show.

// at the loudest sound, which during playback is our own speaker. Steering into the echo is the opposite
// of useful when the echo is what is being removed. A fixed combination of microphones is as fixed as one
// microphone, though, because the microphones do not move: on the Dot, the average of seven canceled
// once measured exactly as well as seven cancellers averaged, and 5 dB better than the center microphone
// alone. Which path it reads is cancelInput's choice.
