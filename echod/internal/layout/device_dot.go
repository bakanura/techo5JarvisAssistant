// The Echo Dot 2 on Fire OS: echod lives under /system/app because that tree is labeled
// system_file, which keeps an init-started service in init's own domain, and it runs as Amazon's
// ledcontroller service, which removes the only other writer of the LED ring and gets init's
// supervision. /system is read-only once installed, so anything written after install goes on /data.
