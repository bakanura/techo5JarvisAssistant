// Package remind is what a reminder does when it comes due: a chime, the label said aloud once, and
// the label left on the screen until somebody deals with it — here, and on whichever other devices
// it was set to go off on.
//
// A reminder is not a ring. It is said once rather than repeated, so it holds nothing open and has
// nothing to snooze; what it keeps is the card, and stopping it anywhere stops it everywhere it went,
// because whoever heard it has dealt with it.
//
// **Saying it.** A device cannot turn words into speech itself. It asks Home Assistant to announce
// the label on this device, in the voice the house's assistant already uses. Without Home Assistant,
// or with the device not allowed to ask, the chime and the screen are all there is.
