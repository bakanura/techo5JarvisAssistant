// A station kept on the device is a name and a stream, played by the device with nothing else
// involved — which is the whole point of it, and which the Dot could not use: starting one happened
// from the radio page, the radio page is a screen, and the Dot has no screen. The device that most
// needs radio without Home Assistant was the one device that could not have it.
//
// So: OwnToggle, which the action button calls (own_button_dot.go). It plays the first station kept
// here, or the one playing before, and stops what is playing if something already is.
