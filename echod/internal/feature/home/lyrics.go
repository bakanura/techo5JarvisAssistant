// library ripped and tagged at home carries its words in the files, often with the time of every
// line, and its lyrics providers (LRCLIB and the rest, when online lookups are on) find them for songs
// from a streaming service. Home Assistant's integration does not pass them on, so the Show asks
// Music Assistant itself, the server Sendspin is paired with, as a user of its own that the installer
// made (docs/lyrics.md). Without that user's token there are simply no lyrics.
