// Finding this device's own media player in Home Assistant.
//
// Guessing it from the device's name was wrong twice over: the guess used the node name, which has
// dashes, where Home Assistant builds entity ids with underscores — so a device whose name had a
// space in it asked Home Assistant to play a station on an entity nobody had, and nothing answered
// because nothing was there. And an entity id does not follow a rename: Home Assistant keys its
// entities on the MAC address, so a renamed device keeps the entity id it was first given, and any
// guess from the new name is wrong again.
//
// So the registry is asked first, which answers the question that was meant: the media player this
// daemon's own device provides, found by the address the two share. That survives a rename, an entity id
// Home Assistant has prefixed with an area, and a device name that is not what Home Assistant displays.
// The name Home Assistant shows comes second, because it is kept in step with the device's own. The
// guess is the answer of last resort, and says so when it is not an entity anybody has.
