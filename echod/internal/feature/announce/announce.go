// Package announce says something in every room: one device tells the others, they chime and put it
// on their screens.
//
// It needs no Home Assistant and no internet — the devices find each other over mDNS and talk to each
// other directly — which is the point of it. A house with the server down can still call everybody to
// dinner.
//
// **Trust.** A device that plays whatever it is sent is a device anything on the network can make
// talk. So an announcement carries a word that the house shares, set on each device's setup page,
// and a device with no word set refuses everything: nothing works until somebody decides it should,
// which is the right way round for a thing that makes noise in a bedroom.
//
// **Quiet hours** are respected: inside them an announcement is shown and not sounded. Alarms,
// timers and calls are not announcements and are not affected (config/quiet.go).
