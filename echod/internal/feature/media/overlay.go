// A url played over whatever is playing, rather than instead of it.
//
// The music keeps going, ducked, and comes back up when this ends — so nothing has to be remembered
// about what was playing, and a Music Assistant group is not left, because this player never takes the
// track from the room in the first place. It is how a camera's own sound is heard: the stream Home
// Assistant converts for this device is read as it arrives and played under a claim that holds the
// music down for as long as the claim lasts.
//
// The url is one this player asked for and was sent back, which is the awkward part: it arrives as an
// ordinary media url, on the same path a track does, with nothing in it to say it is not a track. So the
// request is what says so. The device asks for the next url to be played over the music, which is an ask
// with a token of its own, and the url that answers it plays under that token — never as a track, and
// never in the track history, so a station's name and what is playing are where the room left them.
//
// The token is also what the screen's mute button and the end of a camera's view act on. The player owns
// the identity of what it is playing rather than the feature that asked for it working it out from the
// last url it saw: that url is whatever else has played since.
//
// Muting is not stopping. A muted sound keeps its stream: what arrives is read and thrown away, so the
// sound is back the moment it is brought back, and the music it plays over comes up to its own level
// meanwhile. Stopping is the view ending, and gives the sound up entirely.
