// Package timezone takes the device's time zone from Home Assistant.
//
// The image carries no zone of its own: /etc/localtime is a link to a file on userdata that boot
// makes UTC when there is none yet. Once Home Assistant is connected the device asks it for the time;
// the answer carries Home Assistant's zone as a POSIX rule ("MST7MDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0"), or as a zone
// name from a Home Assistant that sends one. A zone that differs from the one in force is written to
// userdata — a zoneinfo file built from the rule, or a link to the named zone — so it holds across
// reboots, slot changes and Home Assistant being away, and the daemon restarts to pick it up. That
// last part is why nothing here touches time.Local: see apply.
