// Package web is the device's own web port: the camera's pictures, a screenshot of the panel, and
// the setup page, each behind its own switch and all of them off on a device nobody has told
// otherwise.
//
// The port is only listening while at least one of those is switched on. With all of them off there
// is nothing on the network to find, which is the same behavior the camera's own server had before
// this became a place several features share.
//
// It lives on its own rather than inside the camera feature because a Dot has no camera, so that
// server never started there — and the setup page is the only way to configure a device with no
// screen.
