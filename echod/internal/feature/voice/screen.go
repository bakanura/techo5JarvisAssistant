// State is what a turn looks like from outside: which phase it is in and the words so far. It is
// what a screen shows — "Listening…", then what was heard, then the answer — and it is a hook
// rather than a query because a screen wants to redraw the moment something changes, not poll.
//
// Phase is the conversation's own name for it: idle, listening, thinking, replying. Heard and Reply
// are kept through the idle that follows a turn, so whoever shows them can let them linger.
type State struct {
	Phase   string
	Heard   string
	Reply   string
	Backend string // backend chosen for this turn: home assistant or direct
}

// Changed fires on every phase change and whenever a transcript or a reply arrives. It runs on the
// conversation's goroutine, so listeners must not block.
