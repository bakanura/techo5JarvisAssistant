# Genbu marks

The splash draws one of these over the wordmark, matching the screen's palette (`splash_mark.go`).

They come from the JODS Genbu generator (`genbu/main.go`, themes `white`, `leafgreen`, `sakura` and
`ember`), rendered 200 pixels square with resvg and squeezed with oxipng:

    resvg -w 200 genbu-white.svg white.png
    oxipng -o 4 --strip safe *.png

The SVGs are kept with the generator, not here.
