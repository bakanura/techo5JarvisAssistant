// Package firmware is what the device says about its own version, and the channel it follows to
// learn about newer ones.
//
// Home Assistant decides whether an update is worth offering — it compares the two version strings
// itself — and asks for one with a command. All the device does is say what it is running, say what
// it found, and act when told. There is no list of versions in the protocol and no way for Home
// Assistant to ask for a particular one.
