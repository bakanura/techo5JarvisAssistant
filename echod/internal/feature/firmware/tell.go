// Saying that an update is ready. Home Assistant shows its update card, and the screen says so under the
// clock, but nobody opens either to look: the device says it out loud, and again every remindEvery until
// the update is installed, so it cannot be missed. Not in quiet hours, and not when there is nothing to
// say it with; the next check tries again, so a version found at night is said in the morning. With
// automatic installs on there is nothing for anybody to do, so that is said once.
//
// Otherwise it is asked, through Home Assistant, which opens the microphone after the question: "yes"
// installs it there and then, and "not now" leaves it for the next reminder. With no Home Assistant to
// ask through, it is only said.
