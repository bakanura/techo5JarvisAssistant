# Standing on its own: a plan

A TECHO5 device today is a Home Assistant satellite. Turn Home Assistant off and most of it stops:
the clock keeps time and alarms still ring, and that is the lot. This is a plan for the parts that
could work without Home Assistant at all — a clock radio with timers and alarms — so that a used Echo
Show is worth reflashing to someone who does not run Home Assistant, and so that an outage leaves a
useful device rather than a clock.

It was written to be argued with, and it was. What follows is the plan as it stands after that
argument and after most of it shipped; **Where this stands** says which parts are done, which are
half-done, and which were dropped on purpose.

## Where this stands

Checked in the code, 2026-09-21, against releases v0.7.11 / v0.4.8 / v0.5.8.

**Done and released.** M1 timers, M2 radio without Home Assistant (stations kept on the device), M3
the setup page, M4 the time zone. With them: multi-network Wi-Fi, renaming, the diagnostics bundle,
the sleep timer, and the sunrise alarm on all three devices. A Dot can also start and stop the radio
kept on it with two taps of the action button, and any device can play a station from the setup page
before it is saved.

**Half-done, and the worst state to leave anything in.** `feature/announce` is written — the
endpoint, the house word, mDNS discovery, the chime, the quiet-hours check — and **nothing imports
it**, so its registration never runs and none of it is reachable. It has no way in either: nothing
sends an announcement, nothing shows one arriving, and the house word cannot be set. **Quiet hours**
are in the same state by dependency: `config.Quiet()` exists and announce is its only reader, so
today they are two functions nobody calls. Finishing announce is what makes both real, and it is
first in the order below.

**Also unfinished:** the setup page still says the phone account belongs on it and it is not there,
which is where a SIP password should be typed rather than on a five-inch screen. The first-run card
exists but only dismisses itself; it does not yet offer *set this up on its own*.

**Dropped on purpose, so nobody starts them again without asking.**

- *The time or the weather on a button press.* The screen already says both, and the narrow case it
  was for — a dead pipeline, or somebody who cannot read the screen — did not carry it.
- *Presence published to Home Assistant.* The sensing underneath is still wanted for the screen
  waking as somebody approaches; what was dropped is the occupancy entity.
- *The vendor beamformer on a Show or a Spot.* Not an unfinished port: the Show's two microphones sit
  too close together for beamforming to buy anything (porting-plan.md, "averaging or beamforming mics
  this close buys nothing"), so one mic with AEC and NS is the end state there. The vendor's
  beamformer is the Dot's array, and the Dot uses it.

**The order agreed for what is left:** announce, then the intercom (which reuses announce's peers and
trust), the red clock at night, rollback from the screen, Bluetooth audio as a sink, the screen
waking as somebody approaches, a BLE button as local control, Bluetooth provisioning for the Dot,
M5, then "Help" as a wake word, and the smoke alarm last as research rather than a feature.

## What already stands alone

Checked in the code, not remembered:

- **The clock.** `ntpd` sets the time at boot and keeps it (`boot.sh`). It asks, in order, the
  servers the network names in its DHCP lease (option 42), `pool.ntp.org` (or `NTP_SERVER`), and the
  router. A network that answers none of them still leaves two ways: Home Assistant's time, taken when
  it connects, and the update server's, taken by the update check. Either is used only while the clock
  is plainly unset (before 2025). What is missing is not the time but the **zone**, below.
- **Alarms.** Set on the screen, kept in the device's own config, and rung from the device's own
  clock — `feature/alarm` says so in as many words, and it was built that way on purpose.
- **Updates.** `update.Fetch` reads the release from GitHub directly. The update entity is a Home
  Assistant convenience; the General card's *Check now* is not.
- **Wi-Fi.** Joined from the screen, no Home Assistant involved — on a Show or a Spot. A Dot has no
  screen, so its network can only be set over USB at install time (`install-dot.py`).
- **Voice**, if the pipeline is local — but that is a Home Assistant pipeline, so it is not standalone.

## What does not, and why

- **Timers.** `feature/timer`'s first line: *Home Assistant keeps the timers, the device counts them
  down.* The counting and the ringing are already local; only the list is not. Nothing on the device
  creates a timer.
- **Radio.** The device streams the audio itself, but the station list comes over Home Assistant's
  websocket (`feature/home/local.go`, Radio Browser through Home Assistant) and playing one is
  `hass.PlayMedia` against this device's player. No Home Assistant, no radio.
- **The time zone.** `feature/timezone` takes the zone from Home Assistant and from nowhere else. A
  device that has never met a Home Assistant is on UTC, and there is no way to change that from the
  screen. This is a gap in its own right, and the first thing a standalone device would show wrong.
- Weather, cameras, the slideshow, voice: all of them are Home Assistant's, by design. Out of scope.

## M1 — Timers on the device

The easiest, and the one that makes the least noise. The ringing, the countdown ring, the stop word
and the stop button all exist; what is missing is a list of the device's own timers and a way to
start one.

- A local timer in the config beside the alarms: label, length, when it was started.
- A screen to set one — the alarm editor's shape, minus the days of the week.
- `feature/timer` merges the device's own with Home Assistant's, so a house with both sees one list
  in the order they finish.
- "Set a timer for ten minutes" by voice still goes to Home Assistant, because the sentence does.
  Nothing about voice changes.

Open: whether a device timer should appear in Home Assistant as a countdown entity (nice, more
surface) or stay invisible to it (simpler, and honest — it is the device's).

## M2 — Radio without Home Assistant

The device already opens the stream, so this is about knowing what to open.

- **Favorites kept locally**: name, stream URL, optional logo. The Favorites list plays them directly
  rather than calling a Home Assistant script.
- **Home Assistant still wins where it is present.** A device with Home Assistant keeps today's lists
  and its Radio Browser stations; the local list is what a device falls back to, and what a
  standalone device has.
- **Finding stations without Home Assistant.** Radio Browser has a public API
  (`all.api.radio-browser.info`, mirrors found over DNS SRV) that Home Assistant's integration is
  itself a client of. The device can search it directly: by name, by country and state, by tag.
  - *Location.* Today's "stations near home" uses Home Assistant's own coordinates. Standalone, the
    device does not know where it is. Options, least creepy first: the owner picks country and state
    (or types a city or postal code) in setup; or the device asks an IP geolocation service, which
    means telling a third party its address — **opt-in at most, never the default**, and it says so
    on the screen.
  - *Caveat to check before promising it:* Radio Browser supports a geographic search, but a station
    only turns up in it if whoever added it filled in coordinates, and many have not. Country and
    state may well beat distance in practice. Worth measuring against a few real places before the
    UI implies distance is meaningful.
  - Ask for `hidebroken=true`, keep the list to a sane size, cache it, and send the User-Agent
    Radio Browser asks clients to send.

Open: whether to lean on Radio Browser at all when standalone, or to treat a hand-entered list as the
only local source and leave discovery to Home Assistant. Discovery is what makes it pleasant; a
dependency on one volunteer-run service is what makes it fragile.

## M3 — A setup page on the device

Typing a stream URL on a five-inch screen is miserable, so: a small web server on the device, on the
port that already serves the camera and the screenshot (8181).

The shape:

- **Off by default**, like the camera and screen pages. A switch on the device — Settings → Privacy —
  and in Home Assistant where there is one.
- **It turns itself off again.** A setup page that is on for fifteen minutes after you ask for it is
  a different risk from one that is on for a year.
- **A press on the device to get in.** The page says *press the button on your device*, and the
  press authorizes that browser for the session. Physical presence proven, nothing to read, type or
  remember — and unlike a code shown on the panel it works on a Dot, which has no panel. (A code on
  the screen can stay as a second way in on a device that has one.) One press, one session, and it
  expires with the page.
- **Plain HTTP on the LAN.** No certificate that would be worth the trouble on a device with no name.
  Say so plainly in the docs rather than implying it is private.
- **It writes only what it says it writes**: radio favorites, the time zone, the name, maybe the
  Wi-Fi. Never SSH keys, never the Home Assistant key.
- Small enough to serve from the binary: one page, no framework, no fonts to fetch.

This is the piece with real security surface, so it is the one to design slowly and to write down
before writing code.

## M4 — The time zone on the device

A standalone device has to be told where it is, once. Either a picker on the screen (long list,
awkward, but no server needed) or a field on the setup page, with Home Assistant still overriding it
when a Home Assistant is present. Small, and it blocks M1 and M2 being any use in practice — a clock
radio on UTC is a broken clock radio.

## Wi-Fi for a device you are handing to someone else

The case: a device set up here, wiped of its network, and given away. A Show or Spot can join a new
network from its own screen, so this is a convenience there and a genuine hole on a Dot.

What the image already carries: `wpa_supplicant`, `wpa_cli`, `wpa_passphrase` and the whole `iw` and
`iwlist` set. **No `hostapd`, no `dnsmasq`** — a hotspot is not a configuration change, it is new
software in the image, and it only works at all if the vendor driver does AP mode. That driver is
Amazon's `mt76x8_wlan.ko` and an Echo Show never offered tethering, so it may simply not be built in.
Run on a Show, 2026-09-20, the driver says:

    Supported interface modes: managed, AP, P2P-client, P2P-GO
    valid interface combinations: #{ managed, AP, P2P-client, P2P-GO } <= 2, total <= 2, #channels <= 2

It registers three phys, and an **`ap0` interface already exists in AP mode** beside `wlan0`. Two
interfaces on two channels are allowed at once, so a hotspot could run *while* the device stays on
the house network rather than instead of it — which makes a "join my hotspot to move me to your
Wi-Fi" flow possible without dropping off the network first. Still to check on a **Dot**, which is
the device that actually needs this and may not carry the same module.

Three answers to the same problem, cheapest first:

1. **More than one saved network.** `wpa_supplicant` takes several network blocks; the screen only
   ever writes one. Adding a second — their network, before the device leaves the house — solves the
   handing-over case with no new software and no hotspot at all.
2. **Bluetooth provisioning (the Improv standard).** A phone or a Chrome tab hands the credentials
   over BLE; the device already runs BlueZ and its own scanner. This is the only one of the three
   that helps a **Dot**, which is where the hole actually is.
3. **A hotspot to join, with a page to fill in** — conditional on the `iw list` answer above, and the
   most moving parts by far: hostapd, a DHCP server, a captive page, and a rule for when to stop
   being an access point and try the real network again. It pairs with the setup page in M3, since
   both want the same small web server.

## Talking to the other devices in the house

Two features, one shape apart.

**Announce to all** is one-way and short: a message plays in every room. Live audio to six devices at
once is a lot of streams for something nobody talks back to, so record the clip on the device that is
speaking, push it to each of the others, and let them play it behind a chime. A moment's delay before
it starts and nothing to go wrong after; a device that is asleep, busy or on a call takes it when it
can, or refuses and says so.

**Intercom** is two-way and one-to-one, and most of it already exists. The phone feature runs a full
SIP stack with SRTP, and SIP needs no provider: one device can invite another by address with no
registrar in the middle. Today's "calls between your own devices" go out to the provider and back,
which is the wrong shape for two devices ten feet apart — the same stack pointed at the LAN is a
house intercom that works with the internet down.

**Both want the devices to know each other.** They already advertise themselves over mDNS for Home
Assistant and for multi-room audio; a third record, or a flag on an existing one, is enough to build
the list without Home Assistant being asked.

**The part to get right is trust.** A device that plays audio it was sent is a device anything on the
network can make talk. A secret shared by the house, written at install and again from the setup
page, held by every device and required on both ends. Nothing plays from a peer that cannot show it.
Beyond that: a name for each device that the announcement says it came from, a way to refuse
(Do Not Disturb), and a limit on how often a peer may interrupt.

**What this does not need:** Home Assistant, the internet, or an account. That is the point of it.

## The phone, once Home Assistant is gone

Worth writing down, because it is better than expected. The SIP account is the daemon's own — it is
kept in its own file and registers with the provider directly, with no Home Assistant in the path —
and contacts are a file on the device, so an unpaired device **still rings for incoming calls and can
still call the names it already has** from the screen.

What it cannot do alone is provisioning: the account (`phone_account`) and the contact list
(`phone_contacts`) are both set by Home Assistant actions, and dialing by voice needs a pipeline.
Signing in and editing contacts therefore belong on the setup page — a SIP password is the worst
thing anyone will ever type on a five-inch screen.

## The Dot, which has no screen

Every part of this is hardest on a Dot: no screen, no touch, four buttons and a light ring. It is
also the device most worth solving, being cheap enough to put one in every room.

- **Getting on the network.** The only route is Bluetooth provisioning. A Show or a Spot joins a
  network from its own screen; a Dot can only be told over USB at install. This is the whole argument
  for Improv over a hotspot.
- **The setup page is not a convenience here, it is the only interface.** Alarms, the time zone,
  radio favorites, the SIP account: on a Dot there is nowhere else to set any of them. That argues
  for building the page earlier than its place in the order below.
- **Four buttons and a ring.** Action is the one free input: a long press to talk to a default peer,
  or to start and stop the first radio favorite, with the ring showing which. Modest, but it covers
  the two things anyone does daily without an app.
- **Announcing and the intercom suit it best of all.** Speaker, microphones, one per room, and
  nothing anybody needs to look at. A Dot by a bed is the most natural thing in this whole plan.
- **What it will not do standalone** is take a spoken command, because that is a Home Assistant
  pipeline. A Dot with no Home Assistant is an intercom endpoint, an alarm clock and a radio — not a
  voice assistant.

## M5 — What it then says on the tin

If M1 to M4 land, the pitch changes: *a local clock radio with alarms and timers, which becomes a
Home Assistant voice satellite if you run Home Assistant*. That is a much easier first step than
"set up a voice pipeline", and it is true of a device that has never seen Home Assistant.

The README, the getting started guide and the installer all assume Home Assistant today, down to the
installer printing an encryption key and waiting to be paired. A standalone path means an install
that skips the key, and a first-run screen that offers *set this up on its own* beside *connect it to
Home Assistant*.

## Worth doing, in no particular milestone

Each of these stands on its own and none of them blocks anything else.

- **Sunrise alarm.** The screen has brightness control and the alarm already rings from the device's
  own clock; fading the panel up over the quarter hour before it is a small change and the best
  reason yet to put one of these by a bed. Nothing about it needs Home Assistant or the internet.
- **Do Not Disturb hours.** Alarms ring, nothing else makes a sound. It is also what an announcement
  from another device has to respect, so the two are worth designing together.
- **A first-run screen.** Today a device comes up expecting Home Assistant. If any of this lands,
  first boot should offer *set this up on its own* beside *connect it to Home Assistant*, and the
  installer should be able to skip printing a key nobody is going to paste anywhere.
- ~~**The time, or the weather, on a button press.**~~ **Dropped.** The screen says both already.
  No pipeline, no wake word, no cloud: press the
  action button and hear it. The device has no speech of its own — the alarm sounds are synthesized
  notes, not recordings — so this means either a handful of clips built into the image or a small
  local voice. Useful to anyone who cannot read the screen, and it works during an outage.
- **A Bluetooth button as local control.** The BLE radio is already scanning for Home Assistant's
  proxy, so acting on a particular button locally is nearly free: stop the alarm, make an
  announcement, start the radio. A physical button by a bed beats talking to a screen, and it is the
  cheapest accessibility win in this document.
- **Audio from a phone, into the device.** Today the device is a Bluetooth *source* — it plays to
  earbuds. As a *sink*, a phone plays through it, which is what anyone who owned an Echo expects. It
  is a well-trodden path with bluez-alsa, but the daemon owns the speaker, so it means ducking around
  alarms, announcements and voice.
- **A Dot-only build, if memory ever gets tight.** One binary serves all three devices, so a Dot
  carries the screen, camera and slideshow code and never runs a line of it. 512 MB of RAM is half
  the Show's, and the intercom is the first feature to add a continuous audio path on top of
  everything else. Measure before assuming; the lever exists if it is needed.
- **How to build and test a change, written down for someone else.** Two contributors arrived in two
  days and one of them found a bug nobody here could have. The single biggest risk to this project is
  that one person can cut a release; the cheapest thing that helps is a path from "I changed a file"
  to "I tested it on my own unit" that does not depend on asking.

## Useful beyond standing alone

Ideas that are not about Home Assistant being absent, but are worth the room here rather than being
lost in a conversation.

- **A diagnostics bundle, redacted as it is made.** One press collects the log, the state and the
  hardware readings into a file with addresses, SSIDs, serials and keys already replaced by
  placeholders. Twice in two days a stranger has been asked to paste a log with their serial removed,
  which puts the work and the risk on them. This is what makes helping someone cheap, and it keeps
  the no-personal-data rule by construction rather than by remembering.
- **A sleep timer for the radio.** Off in thirty minutes. Every clock radio since 1975 has one and it
  is an afternoon's work.
- **A red clock at night.** Below some brightness the clock turns deep red instead of dim white:
  readable at three in the morning without ruining night vision.
- **Hearing the smoke alarm.** The microphones are already listening with echo cancellation and a
  wake-word engine is already running; the T3 pattern is distinctive. A device that tells a phone the
  alarm is sounding while nobody is home is the best reason yet to put one in a relative's house.
  **It must never be described as a safety device**, and a model that does not cry wolf is real work,
  not a weekend.
- **"Help" as a wake word of its own.** The help call already alerts phones and dials people in turn,
  but it takes a pipeline to start. A local model means it works with the internet down and Home
  Assistant off — the same audience as the alarm above, and far easier to build.
- **Copying a device's settings onto another.** Themes, alarms, cameras, radio favorites, wake word,
  night hours: export from one, restore onto a replacement. Every reinstall pays for it, and so does
  anyone whose unit dies.
- **Going back to the previous version from the screen.** The A/B slots already hold the last good
  root filesystem and `slotctl` can switch them. A button for it means a bad update does not need a
  serial console and a PC.
- ~~**Presence from hardware that is already running.**~~ **Dropped as an entity.** The BLE proxy
  sees phones, the camera sees motion, the microphones hear a room; what was not wanted is an
  occupancy sensor published to Home Assistant. The sensing itself is still needed, for:
- **The screen waking as someone approaches**, off that same signal. No utility at all; people love
  it. **In.** A Show or a Spot only — a Dot has no screen to wake.

## Non-goals

- Reimplementing Home Assistant on the device. Weather, cameras, media libraries and voice stay
  Home Assistant's.
- A general web UI. The setup page configures the few things that cannot be typed on a five-inch
  screen; it is not a second front end for the device.
- Cloud anything. No account, no telemetry, and no phoning an IP geolocation service unless the owner
  asked for it.
- **A music player**: local files, playlists, libraries, a streaming service. It sounds obvious and
  it is a swamp — codecs, artwork, licensing, a library nobody wants to manage on a five-inch screen.
  Radio gives most of what people actually want for a fraction of it, and Music Assistant already
  does the rest through Home Assistant.

## Order, and why

M1 first because it is small, wanted by people who already run Home Assistant, and touches nothing
risky. M4 next because everything else is wrong without it. Then M2, which is the feature people
would actually notice, with M3 as its awkward prerequisite. M5 is documentation and a conversation
about what this project claims to be.
