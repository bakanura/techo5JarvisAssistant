"""Music Assistant left to the metadata a house already has.

Some houses tag their music before Music Assistant ever sees it, and want it to stop looking songs
up on the internet (MusicBrainz, fanart.tv, TheAudioDB, Wikipedia and the rest). That is a switch
on the installer, --music-assistant-local-metadata, and off unless asked for: a house that streams
from a service, or never tagged anything, gets its pictures and biographies from those lookups.

Over Music Assistant's own websocket API (port 8095, a long-lived token made in its settings):
  1. its "online metadata" switch goes off, which stops the lookups for artists, albums and songs
     from every metadata provider, MusicBrainz included, which Music Assistant cannot disable;
  2. the providers that only ever look things up online and that Music Assistant lets be disabled
     are disabled, so none of them is asked for anything else either.
Both are Music Assistant settings, turned back on in its own settings pages.

The same token also gives the Show a Music Assistant user of its own (show_token), for the lyrics of
the song playing, which Home Assistant's integration does not pass on. The user is a plain one, not
an admin; its password is random and thrown away, so only its token, on the Show, ever signs in. The
installer's token is used for that and kept nowhere.
