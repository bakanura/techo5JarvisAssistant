"""The OpenJade logo in place of Amazon's at boot, on a Show that already runs Jarvis.

What the bootloader paints before Linux starts is compiled into kaeru, amonet's bootloader in the expdb
partition (docs/hardware.md, "Boot logo (LK)"). Crown's and Checkers' kaeru hold Amazon's wordmark in
the same 6105-byte slot, byte for byte, at different places. tools/boot-logo/openjade-wordmark.bin is
that slot with the OpenJade lockup in it (tools/boot-logo/README.md says how it was made).

The install never touches expdb. This is a step of its own, asked for by name, over the Show's SSH:
the slot is written in place, so kaeru's header, length and pointers stay as they are, and only over the
kaeru amonet 2.0.1 put there. Afterwards the whole of kaeru is read back from the flash; if it is not
exactly what was meant, the slot that was there goes back at once. A unit whose kaeru is broken does not
start at all, so nothing here writes anywhere else, and nothing writes over a kaeru it does not know.
