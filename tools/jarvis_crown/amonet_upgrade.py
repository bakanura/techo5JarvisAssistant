"""Move a Checkers unlocked with Amonet 1.x to the 2.x layout, from TWRP.

Amonet 1.x left a microloader at the start of boot, and the install gate refuses to write over it. The
way out the Amonet author gives (XDA thread 4762900) is flashing the 2.x zip in TWRP. Its update-binary
rewrites the preloader (boot0), lk, tee1, tee2, expdb (kaeru), recovery and swdl, wipes misc and
reboots to recovery. This stage runs exactly that, and nothing else, under these conditions:

- the Amonet and Lineage zips match their pins in assets.py (an unpinned Amonet zip is refused);
- the zip's device.prop names the board and carries every binary the update-binary needs;
- the unit is the board in TWRP, as root, and boot really starts with the 1.x microloader;
- every partition the update-binary will resolve is the one expected, so the backup covers it;
- a verified backup of all of them exists (backup_recovery_state, under before-amonet2/);
- the operator typed the exact phrase.

Afterwards each written partition is compared with the zip's bytes. Then boot.img from the pinned
Lineage zip goes onto boot (mmcblk0p9, checked by name), so boot no longer holds the microloader and
the normal install gate can pass.
